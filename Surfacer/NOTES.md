When satellite debris gets out of hand

## PRESENTLY

Making the "sway" shader for greebling. 
    - works
    - GreeblingParticleSimulation assigns a constant radius... should be per-texture (atlas component)
    - add a uniform 'period' instead of hardcoded 3.14159

    
## BUGS PRIORITY HIGH
- observe TerrainWorld::417 cpSpaceBBQuery - I might be able to use cpSPace queries to test if attachments are inside the cut volume. might be a lot faster than my approach, since chipmunk is pretty optimized.

## BUGS PRIORITY LOW

Consider rewriting DrawDispatcher using raw pointers and not shared_ptr<> ?

CameraControllerComponent is acting oddly - it no longer allows camera re-centering when alt key is pressed.
	This is not a bug but the architecture acting as designed. The input is gobbled.
	Is this an ordering issue? who's gobbling the input?
	Is there a robust way to respond to this from a design standpoint?

## NOTES
Contour where the last vertex == the first cause tons of problems. util::simplify automatically removes that last vertex for me in the process of simplification.

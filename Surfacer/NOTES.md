#Surfacer Modernization Rewrite

This is going to be done in steps; since I need to learn new Cinder APIs (primarily the new vector/matrix/etc stuff), and I need to learn the modern OpenGL stuff.

##Phases

###One
Get a modern shaded geometry on the screen. 
This will necessitate grokking the new cinder maths and basics of modern opengl

###Two
Start rewriting the contents of _original/Surfacer/Core
This will get me my basic gameobject/component system, draw dispatching, etc

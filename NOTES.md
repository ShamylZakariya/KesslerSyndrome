# Dev Notes

## PRESENTLY

Renter to Texture Viewport
- Reduce viewport sphagetti
- Move viewport controller out of scenario - scenario should only know about viewport(s)
- need some kind of compositor pass in the scenario (does it punt to stage?)

Tests app should offer all test scenarios, and should just switch between them, lazily create/destroy them


## BUGS PRIORITY HIGH
- observe TerrainWorld::417 cpSpaceBBQuery - I might be able to use cpSPace queries to test if attachments are inside the cut volume. might be a lot faster than my approach, since chipmunk is pretty optimized.

## BUGS PRIORITY LOW

Consider rewriting DrawDispatcher using raw pointers and not shared_ptr<> ?

CameraControllerComponent is acting oddly - it no longer allows camera re-centering when alt key is pressed.
	This is not a bug but the architecture acting as designed. The input is gobbled.
	Is this an ordering issue? who's gobbling the input?
	Is there a robust way to respond to this from a design standpoint?

## NOTES
Contour where the last vertex == the first cause tons of problems. util::simplify automatically removes that last vertex for me in the process of simplification.
